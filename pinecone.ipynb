As a kid, he was scared of the dark, just like many of us. But when he realized that darkness is simply the absence of light, it seemed silly to be afraid of something that wasn't even there. And just like that, his fear vanished.\n",

      "So, maybe the meaning of life lies in finding those moments that make your heart sing. It could be spending quality time with loved ones, pursuing your passions, or even just taking a moment to appreciate the beauty around you.\n",

      "So, my friend, let go of those fears, carve out time for what truly lights you up, and embrace the moments that make life meaningful to you. Because in the end, it's your journey, and you have the power to make it extraordinary.\n"
